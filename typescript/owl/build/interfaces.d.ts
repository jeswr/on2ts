/**
 * "
 *   This ontology partially describes the built-in classes and
 *   properties that together form the basis of the RDF/XML syntax of OWL 2.
 *   The content of this ontology is based on Tables 6.1 and 6.2
 *   in Section 6.4 of the OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics specification,
 *   available at http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-rdf-based-semantics/.
 *   Please note that those tables do not include the different annotations
 *   (labels, comments and rdfs:isDefinedBy links) used in this file.
 *   Also note that the descriptions provided in this ontology do not
 *   provide a complete and correct formal description of either the syntax
 *   or the semantics of the introduced terms (please see the OWL 2
 *   recommendations for the complete and normative specifications).
 *   Furthermore, the information provided by this ontology may be
 *   misleading if not used with care. This ontology SHOULD NOT be imported
 *   into OWL ontologies. Importing this file into an OWL 2 DL ontology
 *   will cause it to become an OWL 2 Full ontology and may have other,
 *   unexpected, consequences.
